# Generic Hybrid Cloud Architecture Guide

## Overview
This document outlines a provider-agnostic hybrid cloud architecture that combines on-premises infrastructure with public cloud services. The architecture focuses on core services including container orchestration, database services, storage solutions, and messaging systems.
